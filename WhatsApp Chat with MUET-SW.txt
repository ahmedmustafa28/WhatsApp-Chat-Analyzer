3/2/25, 3:17 PM - +92 335 3093489: Hiring ASO Specialist for Google Play Store – Project-Based (Remote)

I need someone who knows the ins and outs of the Google Play Store to upload an Android app and handle the approval process. If you’ve dealt with app rejections and Play Store policies, this should be easy for you.

✅ Project-based work – just upload the app and get it live
✅ If things go well, we can work together on future ASO and marketing
✅ Remote & flexible – work from anywhere, at your own time

If you’ve got the experience and can get the job done without issues, let’s connect.

Long Live Student Struggle 

Invitation
The students of Mehran University, Jamshoro, have announced a rally against the construction of canals. The purpose of the rally is to raise public awareness about the negative impacts of canals on Sindh's natural resources, agricultural lands, and environmental balance.

The canals pose serious threats to Sindh's agricultural economy and ecosystem, which cannot be ignored. During the rally, students will voice their demands through slogans, posters, and banners opposing the canals.

"This land is ours,
This water is ours,
What is rightfully ours,
We will claim it at all costs."
(Sheikh Ayaz)

We urge all conscious students of Mehran University to join us so that we can collectively resist and nullify every anti-Sindh action.

Location:
From Central Cafeteria, Mehran University to Main Gate

4/7/25, 7:11 AM - Adil Memon 21SW: Hello everyone,
Recently, I became aware of Microsoft’s involvement with the Israeli military. As a Muslim, I cannot stay silent while our Palestinian brothers and sisters suffer. This has been a difficult decision for me.

Being a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) was truly an honor. Over the past three years, I’ve learned so much and had the privilege of building a city-wide chapter, MLSA Hyderabad. However, my faith and conscience must come first. Until this genocide ends, I am officially boycotting the promotion of Microsoft products at all events. I believe it is my duty to stand for justice and right now, that means stepping away from anything aligned with actions I cannot support.

From now on, our community will be known as Students Community Hyderabad. We remain open to collaborations, just as we always have, and we will continue to empower students in tech helping them to learn, collaborate, and grow together. While we will no longer promote Microsoft products, we will return stronger with the support of various international sponsors and collaborators.
Indeed, we are one unit, standing with Palestine.

As Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) said:
“Whoever sees an injustice, let him change it with his hand; if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart—and that is the weakest of faith.” (Sahih Muslim)

This is my way of standing with the oppressed.
May justice prevail for Palestine, and may Allah (SWT) guide us all.

4/19/25, 2:06 AM - +92 311 8239764: Hello Everyone,
I hope you all are doing well!
As per the HEC policies, everyone has to do an internship of at least 6 weeks in their undergraduate program to be eligible to achieve their degrees. Said that, the coming summer vacations are a golden opportunity for you to do this. Specially for 2nd and 3rd years students (final year students as well if they haven't done any internships yet, and freshies can also utilise this vacations doing any internship). 
Try hunting some real internships; instead of those CodeSoft CodeAlpha kinda fake internships which will only waste your time.
Currently, many of the software houses have started hiring summer interns. You can easily find many opportunities on linkedin.
4/19/25, 2:08 AM - +92 311 8239764: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318951633088868354?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7318951633088868354%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318951633088868354?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7318951633088868354%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29

This is a good company, and their internship will really help you in grabbing experience of implementing your skills.

5/7/25, 10:20 AM - +92 307 2360542: *دشمن سے خطرے کے وقت دعا*

سیدنا ابو موسی اشعری رضی اللہ عنہ بیان کرتے ہیں کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کو جب کسی قوم سے کوئی اندیشہ ہوتا تو اس طرح دعا کرتے  :
*«اَللَّهُمَّ إِنَّا نَجْعَلُكَ فِي نُحُورِهِمْ وَنَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شُرُورِهِمْ».*
’’اے اللہ! ہم تجھے ان کے مقابلے میں کرتے ہیں اور ان کے شر سے تیری پناہ میں آتے ہیں۔‘‘ 
(سنن أبي داود : ١٥٣٧)

دشمنوں اور بد طینت لوگوں کے شرور سے بچنے کےلئے مشروع مادی اسباب اختیار کرنا، ان کے خلاف جہاد کرنا اور ان کے پرخچے اڑا دینا ضروری ہے، اس کے ساتھ مومن کے لیے اللہ تعالی پر توکل اور اس کی رحمت کا سائل رہنا مسلمان کا فریضہ اور اس کا شعار ہے۔

 *﴿رَبَّنَا أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَانصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ﴾.*
’’اے ہمارے رب! ہم پر صبر انڈیل دے اور ہمارے قدم ثابت رکھ اور ان کافر لوگوں کے خلاف ہماری مدد فرما۔‘‘

دشمن افواج جمع ہو کر آ جائیں تو....؟؟

﴿اَلَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ النَّاسُ إِنَّ النَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُوا لَكُمْ فَاخْشَوْهُمْ فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَقَالُوا حَسْبُنَا اللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ﴾. 
’’وہ لوگ کہ جب انہیں کہا گیا کہ: لوگوں نے تمہارا مقابلے کرنے کے لیے ایک بڑا لشکر جمع کرلیا ہے، لہٰذا ان سے ڈر جاؤ۔ تو ان کا ایمان اور بھی زیادہ ہوگیا اور کہنے لگے : 
﴿حَسْبُنَا اللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ﴾.
ہمیں تو اللہ ہی کافی ہے اور وہ بہت اچھا کارساز ہے۔‘‘ 
(سورة آل عمران : ١٧٣)

For the students of batches 22 and 23 who are asking about internships  I have connections with some software houses through my seniors from F16, 17, and 18. I can definitely help to connect you with them. Also, for those who want to learn a new skill but are unsure about the roadmap, you can check out this site for a clearer path and guidance: 
https://roadmap.sh/
And for more helpful resources, feel free to visit my GitHub Profile, you’ll find a collection of valuable learning materials there:

6/21/25, 11:53 PM - +92 310 6387577: As a developer, you know the hassle of reinstalling Windows and then having to reinstall all your development tools and software, like Red Panda C++, VSCode, Python, Java, etc. Is there a way to bundle your development environment with the Windows installation? In Linux, this is achievable by creating a custom distro. You can install a base Linux distro, add all the software you need, and then create an ISO file or a bootable USB drive. Can something similar be done with Windows?

It is difficult in windows as compare to linux butmight want to explore options like:

1. *Windows Answer File*: An XML file that automates Windows installation and configuration.
2. *Windows Deployment Services*: A role service that allows you to deploy Windows images.
3. *Chocolatey*: A package manager for Windows that can automate software installation.
4. *Custom Windows images*: You can create a custom Windows image with pre-installed software using tools like DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management).

I’m a student from 21PG, Mehran University. Today, July 28th at around 1:00 PM, we were robbed on our way home from university—just after crossing Tool Plaza.

Three men on a 125 bike hit our moving bike on the highway, making us fall. Two of them had pistols. They took 3 mobile phones and over 35,000 PKR cash from us. Some students from 21BECS stopped to help, thinking it was an accident, and the robbers took their phones too.

Please be very careful while traveling and share this message with other students of Jamshoro universities.

8/15/25, 7:18 PM - +92 312 3089270: ‎Hey everyone. Today officially marks the end of my tenure as the President of AIC. 
‎
‎When we started AIC, it was nothing more than an idea, and turning it into a proper society was full of struggles and efforts. Getting permissions, convincing people, organizing events for the first time, it wasn’t easy. But i had a wonderful team to support and help me, and together we did not just form the society, but also made a lasting mark in the department of software engineering.
‎
‎As the first president, one of my proudest moment will be AIC playfest. Just in the first year, we were able to arrange a mega event in hopes to give the students a reason to celebrate and have fun. 
‎
‎Tonight, I officially pass the torch to a new team.  Although, I will continue to serve as a mentor, supporting the next team as they make AIC even better.
‎
‎Thanks everyone for your support, especially our team, and the seniors.

Hello! I’m Sarwat Aijaz, the current AWS Cloud Club Captain. So the thing is that our department has many societies and clubs, each with its own initiative and goal. Similarly, AWS Cloud Club is a global community with chapters worldwide, including MUET, that helps students explore tech fields like app & web development, DevOps, and cloud computing, etc. with a focus on AWS technologies.

Regarding membership, the core team is selected annually, but for now, everyone can join the workshops, sessions, and volunteer ship opportunities to gain experience and grow in the tech field.

If you want to stay updated regarding AWS Cloud Club, kindly join our WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/ErEpgyFcF4XGvE3oSfrlGA?mode=ems_copy_t

Since alot of people have been reaching out to me regarding Expo let me clarify,

Expo is divided into two showcases

1: Tech Expo: This is solely for 21 Batch of software dept since its Showcase of final year projects of 21 batch, you guys don’t have to fill forms for it or make payment. The Techxhibit form is not for you people. 

2: Techxhibit: This is for FEECE faculty, and from software dept it is 22 batch onwards, you guys need to fill the form for it to register, bringing standee is optional.
The project should be tech related and you can showcase it through a standee, maybe add a QR code and also you can showcase in your laptops. 
21 batch please yeh forms na fill karein 🙏 this is not for you guys. 

Anyone who wants to register for TechXhibit, kindly fill this form before 12:00pm today 

Both of these will be on 24th sept 2025 and will start at 8:00am onwards.

25th sept 2025 is for Technival which will be held in sw dept and recruitment drive will be in ORIC.

Umeed he I was clear and everyone is getting these scribbles of words.
Thank you.😮‍💨

9/28/25, 4:58 PM - Arham Abbas: For those asking why *slots are limited* , we can’t accommodate the whole department at once. That’s why it’s on a *first-come, first-served basis*. Once we hit the limit, registrations will close and no one else will be allowed.
9/28/25, 5:09 PM - Jahanzeb Ansari: For all those who will be attending Sham e Sufyana for the first time here are some glimpses from the last one.

1) Only pay to the person mentioned in the form’s bio. If you pay anyone else, it will not be counted as registration and your payment may get stuck. To keep everything secure and transparent, always pay to the authorized person only

2) Payment alone does not confirm your slot ,filling the form is mandatory. If you pay but don’t fill the form and registration closes, your amount will be refunded.

Thank you!!

Tense situations all across the country after TLP chief reported shot with 3 wounds. 

It is advised for all public to halt travel and outing plans until the situation subsides.

‼️ *Remember: TLP is a politically motivated party NOT a religious movement. DO NOT risk your life on roads in protests. If you want to do something for Islam, there are many different ways.*

*I repeat: DO NOT FIGHT THE STATE in times of extreme crisis when all borders are under threat. Do not be a party to internal anarchists. The timing is not right*

- Chances of intense protests and anarchy throughout the region.

Same is the case for US embassy in Pakistan

Which means then all your borders + airspace will be under threat too

InshaAllah, we’re planning to hold a session this Friday. I kindly request all members to share the flyer with their respective GRs, so they can forward it to their class girls’ groups.

 *Please note that this session is only for girls*

*As for the topic, we’ll be starting with a beautiful discussion about Allah swt. It’s not mentioned on the flyer intentionally so that students join out of curiosity, InshaAllah. 
Hope it works well, بِإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ!

11/5/25, 10:34 PM - Arham Abbas: Thank you everyone who came today, especially for the lovely comments <3 I really loved the way you showed your love! And for those who missed it , don’t worry, you can still do that :))
11/5/25, 11:20 PM - Adil Memon 21SW: It was a wonderful time as you all came and actively participated. Thank you, everyone, for joining us during the *Celebration Week!* I’ll always remember you all and truly appreciate your lovely comments. *You can still share your comments* if you missed it earlier and remember, I’ll always be here to support you whenever you need any help.❤️
11/5/25, 11:21 PM - Jahanzeb Ansari: The Batch of 21 is truly a legendary batch that will be remembered for years to come in our department. The bond they shared with their juniors was unlike anything I’ve seen or heard before. So genuine and down to earth. It didn’t even feel like a graduation week, it felt like a celebration for everyone. Every year, we hear people say the department won’t be the same without a batch, but with the 21 batch, that sentiment is absolutely authentic. Their farewell was unforgettable, with every junior from batches 22, 23, 24, and 25 participating wholeheartedly. Thank you for leaving behind such unforgettable memories, even as you bid farewell. May Allah bless each of you with ultimate success in life✨
