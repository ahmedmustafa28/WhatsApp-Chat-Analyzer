The bond they shared with their juniors was unlike anything I’ve seen or heard before. So genuine and down to earth. It didn’t even feel like a graduation week, it felt like a celebration for everyone. Every year, we hear people say the department won’t be the same without a batch, but with the 21 batch, that sentiment is absolutely authentic. Their farewell was unforgettable, with every junior from batches 22, 23, 24, and 25 participating wholeheartedly. Thank you for leaving behind such unforgettable memories, even as you bid farewell. May Allah bless each of you with ultimate success in life✨\n",

       " 'Adil Memon 21SW: Hello everyone,\\nRecently, I became aware of Microsoft’s involvement with the Israeli military. As a Muslim, I cannot stay silent while our Palestinian brothers and sisters suffer. This has been a difficult decision for me.\\n\\nBeing a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) was truly an honor. Over the past three years, I’ve learned so much and had the privilege of building a city-wide chapter, MLSA Hyderabad. However, my faith and conscience must come first. Until this genocide ends, I am officially boycotting the promotion of Microsoft products at all events. I believe it is my duty to stand for justice and right now, that means stepping away from anything aligned with actions I cannot support.\\n\\nFrom now on, our community will be known as Students Community Hyderabad. We remain open to collaborations, just as we always have, and we will continue to empower students in tech helping them to learn, collaborate, and grow together. While we will no longer promote Microsoft products, we will return stronger with the support of various international sponsors and collaborators.\\nIndeed, we are one unit, standing with Palestine.\\n\\nAs Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) said:\\n“Whoever sees an injustice, let him change it with his hand; if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart—and that is the weakest of faith.” (Sahih Muslim)\\n\\nThis is my way of standing with the oppressed.\\nMay justice prevail for Palestine, and may Allah (SWT) guide us all.\\n\\n#StandWithPalestine #JusticeForPalestine #BoycottMicrosoft\\n',\n",

Said that, the coming summer vacations are a golden opportunity for you to do this. Specially for 2nd and 3rd years students (final year students as well if they haven't done any internships yet, and freshies can also utilise this vacations doing any internship). \\nTry hunting some real internships; instead of those CodeSoft CodeAlpha kinda fake internships which will only waste your time.\\nCurrently, many of the software houses have started hiring summer interns.

       " '+92 310 6387577: As a developer, you know the hassle of reinstalling Windows and then having to reinstall all your development tools and software, like Red Panda C++, VSCode, Python, Java, etc. Is there a way to bundle your development environment with the Windows installation? In Linux, this is achievable by creating a custom distro. You can install a base Linux distro, add all the software you need, and then create an ISO file or a bootable USB drive. Can something similar be done with Windows?\\n\\nIt is difficult in windows as compare to linux butmight want to explore options like:\\n\\n1. *Windows Answer File*: An XML file that automates Windows installation and configuration.\\n2. *Windows Deployment Services*: A role service that allows you to deploy Windows images.\\n3. *Chocolatey*: A package manager for Windows that can automate software installation.\\n4. *Custom Windows images*: You can create a custom Windows image with pre-installed software using tools like DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management).\\n',\n",
